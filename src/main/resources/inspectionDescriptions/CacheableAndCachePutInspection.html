<p>Reports <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/CachePut.html">@CachePut</a>
  and <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/Cacheable.html">@Cacheable</a>
  annotations declared on the same method.</p>

While <code>@Cacheable</code> causes the method to skip the execution using the cache, <code>@CachePut</code> forces the execution in order
to update the cache.
This leads to unexpected behavior and should be avoided, except in very specific cases when conditions in annotations exclude them from each
other.
Note also that such conditions should not rely on the result object (the <code>#result</code> variable) as these are validated upfront to
confirm the exclusion.
