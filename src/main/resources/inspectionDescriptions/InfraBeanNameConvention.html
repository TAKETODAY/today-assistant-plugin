Write your description here.
Start the description with a verb in 3rd person singular, like reports, detects, highlights.
In the first sentence, briefly explain what exactly the inspection helps you detect.
Make sure the sentence is not very long and complicated.
<p>
  The first sentence must be in a dedicated paragraph separated from the rest of the text. This will make the description easier to read.
  Make sure the description doesnâ€™t just repeat the inspection title.

<p>Reports <strong>&lt;bean&gt;</strong> names that don't follow the bean naming conventions.</p>

<p>
  The convention is to use the standard Java convention for instance field names when naming beans.
  That is, bean names start with a lowercase letter and are camel-cased from there.
  Examples of such names include <code>accountManager</code>, <code>accountService</code>, <code>userDao</code>, <code>loginController</code>, and so on.
  Naming beans consistently makes your configuration easier to read and understand.
  Also, if you are using Infra AOP, it helps a lot when applying an advice to a set of beans related by name.
