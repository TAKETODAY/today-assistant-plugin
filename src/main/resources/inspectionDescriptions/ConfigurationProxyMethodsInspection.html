Reports warnings on incorrectly used proxy methods.

Infra 4.0 has introduced an optimization for @Configuration class processing that can be enabled via an attribute
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false).
<br><br>
If you disable
<pre><code>proxyBeanMethods</code></pre>
the proxy instances are no longer created and calling the method invokes it again (returning a new instance every time).
As a result, you have no guarantee that you're actually injecting the corresponding bean in the context.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<br><br>
<strong>Incorrect bean method call example:</strong><br><br>
<pre>
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class TestConfiguration {
  @Bean
  public FirstBean firstBean() {
    return new FirstBean();
  }

  @Bean
  public SecondBean secondBean() {
    return new SecondBean(firstBean()); // -> <strong>incorrect call</strong>
  }
}
</pre>
<br>

<hr>
<strong>You can set
  <pre><code>proxyBeanMethods</code></pre>
  to true or rewrite the code as follows:</strong><br><br>
<pre>
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class TestConfiguration {
  @Bean
  public FirstBean firstBean() {
    return new FirstBean();
  }

  @Bean
  public SecondBean secondBean(FirstBean someBean) { // -> <strong>correct injected instance</strong>
    return new SecondBean(someBean);
  }
}
</pre>
<br>

<hr>
<strong>Also, the inspection checks @Bean method calls in a class without the @Configuration stereotype (in "bean lite mode"):</strong><br><br>
<pre>
@Component
class TestComponent {
  @Bean
  public FirstBean firstBean() {
    return new FirstBean();
  }

  @Bean
  public SecondBean secondBean() {
    return new SecondBean(firstBean()); // -> <strong>incorrect call</strong>
  }
}
</pre>
