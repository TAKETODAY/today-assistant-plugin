<p>Reports referenced abstract beans.</p>

<p>Abstract beans can be used only as template bean definitions, that is, parents for child definitions.
  Trying to use such an abstract parent bean on its own by referring to it as a ref property of another bean,
  or by calling <code>getBean()</code> with the parent bean id, will result in an error.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre><code>
  &lt;bean abstract="true" id="parentBeanWithoutClass"/&gt;
  &lt;bean class="com.my.company.FooBean" id="childBean" parent="parentBeanWithoutClass"&gt;
  &lt;!--  properties --&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the parent bean can't be instantiated on its own since it is incomplete and explicitly marked as abstract.</p>
